# Privacy-and-Fairness-in-Deep-Learning
Adversarial Attacks, Defences, and Mitigating Biases
# Description
•	Implemented white-box attacks like Projected Gradient Descent, Carlini-Wagner L2 and black-box attacks like Shadow Model Attacks
•	Defended the models from these attacks using Augmented and Madry Defenses
•	Mitigated biases in deep learning models using GAN like adversarial training to achieve demographic parity, equality of opportunity and equality of odds as well as debiasing of word embeddings
